30 days of react:

Day 1: 

Today i learned how to create react app by directly using create-react-app and using vite.
Also i learned how to make a basic component in react which includes -
- import, export 
- fragments : If we pass a component in App.jsx then it does not allow us to use HTML elements individually. Therefore, we either wrap inside <div></div> or we use <></> 
- Component : Naming should be capitalize. Components are nothing but custom elements that we can create fro our project.
